# DailyHabits

A simple Ract.js based application for daily habits management.

With this app you can define your daily habits that you want to support and those that you want to get rid of. By logging all instances of these events you can keep track of your progress in reaching established goals. Just one click is enough to add a new entry and see an updated summary.

I recommend building this app using Visual Studio, but one can also use CLI tools as this is an ASP.NET core application.

This application is a website, not a desktop appication, but I'm not planning on publishing it. Mostly due to the General Data Protection Regulation. I simply don't have time nor will to make this app compliant with these regulations. **Anyone can host it locally, though.**
